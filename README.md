## I'm Bresnow.
#### I create digital products and identity assets.

#### This repo hub is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨  mess... almost everything in here is in development or a rough draft. I'm putting together an organization page for my finished stuff. My comments contain swear words and have no regard for spelling or grammar... because im a a fucking gangsta


As an interface designer, I organize, plan, and create using any surface where two objects or forces meet. Indeed, given enough time, space and opportunity.

I was educated as a graphic designer/ illustrator but I am a self-taught in javascript, docker, and shell.
